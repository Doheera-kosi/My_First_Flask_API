# My_First_Flask_API

# My Hello World Application
This is a simple Flask application that responds with "Hello World!" when accessed.

## Installation
To run this application, you need to have Python and Flask installed on your system.

Install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install Flask using pip: pip install flask.

## Usage

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where this application's code is saved.

- Run the application by typing python <filename>.py (where <filename> is the name of the Python file).

- Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000/. You should see the message "Hello World!" displayed on the page.

## Troubleshooting
If the application fails to run, try the following:

- Make sure that Python and Flask are installed correctly.
- Check the code for any syntax errors or typos.
- Check that there are no other applications running on port 5000, which is the default port used by Flask.
- Try running the application with debugging enabled by setting debug=True in the app.run() method. This will show more detailed error messages in the console.
